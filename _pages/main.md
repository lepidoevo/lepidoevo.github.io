Hello, Everyone!

I am a master's student interested in the astonishing diversity and ecological range of insects (currently Lepidoptera-butterflies and moths). I want to learn and study this phenomenon using various data (e.g. molecular data, ecological traits, morphology, etc.) and different perspectives (e.g. phylogeny, biogeography, gene expression, evo-devo, etc.). As not only a student but also a scientist, I would like to search the gaps of current findings within insect-evolution world and collaborate with many researchers to decipher those!

## My present works:
- Phylogenomics of the subfamily Erebinae and its neighboring taxa
- Systematic taxonomy of the subfamily Erebinae in the Korean Peninsula

## My interests encompasses the following ends:
-	Phylogenomics of Lepidoptera and their high biodiversity
-	Coevolution of Lepidoptera and Angiosperm
-	Revealing evolutionary trajectories of living things through integrative approach with fossil data, ecological data, and gene family data that might be detected from molecular data 
-	Biogeography
-	Population genetics and species delimitation for taxonomic purpose (e.g., detecting over- or underestimation of certain taxa)
