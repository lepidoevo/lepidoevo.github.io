Hello, Everyone!

I am a master student interested in the astonishing diversity and ecological range of insects (currently Lepidoptera-butterflies and moths). I want to teach myself and study about this phenomenon with various data (e.g. molecular data, ecological traits, morphology, etc.) and different views (e.g. phylogeny, biogeography, gene expression, evo-devo, etc.). As both of student and scientist, I'd like to search the gaps of current knowledge within insect evolution and collaborate with many researchers to resolve many unsolved scientific questions!

## My current works:
- Phylogenomics of the subfamily Erebinae and its neighboring taxa
- Systematic taxonomy of the subfamily Erebinae in Korea

## My interests encompasses the following ends:
-	Phylogenomics of Lepidoptera (especially Noctuoidea, Erebidae) and their high biodiversity
-	Coevolution of Lepidoptera and Angiosperm
-	Evolutionary study by integrative approach with fossil data, ecological data of insects, and gene families that can be constructed from omics data
-	Biogeography
-	Population genetics and species delimitation for detecting over- or underestimation of specific species
