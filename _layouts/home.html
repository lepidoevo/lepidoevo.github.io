  <p>Hello, Everybody!</p>

  <p>I am a master student interested in the astonishing diversity and ecological range of insects (currently <strong>Lepidoptera</strong>, i.e., butterflies and moths). I hope to teach myself and conduct studies on these phenomena using a variety of data (e.g., molecular data, ecological traits, morphology, etc.) and perspectives (e.g., phylogeny, biogeography, gene expression, evo-devo, etc.). As a student and a scientist, I'd like to search the gaps of current knowledge within insect evolution and collaborate with many researchers to resolve numerous unsolved scientific issues!</p>

  <h2>My current works:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Phylogenomics of the Erebine lineage</strong> (subfamily Erebinae and its neighboring taxa)</li>
    <li>Systematic taxonomy of the subfamily Erebinae in Korea</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>My interests comprehend the following topics:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Phylogenomics of Lepidoptera (especially Noctuoidea, Erebidae) and their high biodiversity</li>
    <li>Coevolution of insects, plants, and microbes</li>
    <li>Evolutionary study by integrative approach with fossil records, ecological features, and omics data</li>
    <li>Biogeography</li>
    <li>Population genetics and species delimitation for detecting over- or underestimation of specific species</li>
  </ul>
