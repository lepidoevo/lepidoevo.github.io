  <p>Hello, Everybody!</p>

  <p>I am a master's student interested in the astonishing diversity and ecological range of insects (currently Lepidoptera-butterflies and moths). I want to learn and study this phenomenon using various data (e.g., molecular data, ecological traits, morphology, etc.) and different perspectives (e.g., phylogeny, biogeography, gene expression, evo-devo, etc.). As not only a student but also a scientist, I would like to search the gaps of current findings within insect-evolution world and collaborate with many researchers to decipher those!</p>

  <h2>My present works:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Phylogenomics of the Erebine lineage</strong> (subfamily Erebinae and its neighboring taxa)</li>
    <li>Systematic taxonomy of the subfamily Erebinae of the Korean Peninsula</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>My interests comprehend the following topics:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Phylogenomics of Lepidoptera and their high biodiversity</li>
    <li>Coevolution of Lepidoptera and Angiosperm</li>
    <li>Revealing evolutionary trajectories of living things through integrative approach with fossil data, ecological data, and gene family data that might be detected from molecular data</li> 
    <li>Biogeography</li>
    <li>Population genetics and species delimitation for taxonomic purpose (e.g., detecting over- or underestimation of certain taxa)</li>
  </ul>
