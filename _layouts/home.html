  <p>Hello, Everybody!</p>

  <p>I am a master's student interested in the astonishing diversity and ecological range of insects (currently Lepidopteraâ€”butterflies and moths). I am learning and studying those phenomena using various data (e.g., genomic data, ecological traits, morphology, etc.) and several biological perspectives (e.g., phylogeny, gene expression, etc. ). As not only a student but also a scientist, I would like to find missing parts of current knowledge of insect science and collaborate with scientists who have similar curiosity to decipher such questions!</p>

  <h2>My present works</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Evolution of the erebid moths</strong></li>
    <li>Systematic taxonomy of the subfamily Erebinae in the Korean Peninsula</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>My interests</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Disclosing the secrets of high biodiversity within lepidopteran insects</li>
    <li>Coevolution between lepidopterans and their primary food source (plants, especially angiosperms)</li>
    <li>Revealing evolutionary trajectories of living things via an integrative approach with fossil data, ecological data, and particularly molecular data</li> 
    <li>Phylogeography</li>
    <li>Population genomics for various purposes (e.g., species delimitaion, to find over- or underestimation of certain taxa, to recover the evolutionary routes of certain target living things)</li>
  </ul>
