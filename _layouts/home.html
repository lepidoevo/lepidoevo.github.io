  <p>Hello, Everyone!</p>

  <p>I am a master student interested in the astonishing diversity and ecological range of insects (currently <strong>Lepidoptera</strong>, i.e. butterflies and moths). I want to teach myself and study about this phenomenon with various data (e.g. molecular data, ecological traits, morphology, etc.) and assorted views (e.g. phylogeny, biogeography, gene expression, evo-devo, etc.). As both of student and scientist, I'd like to search the gaps of current knowledge within insect evolution and collaborate with many researchers to resolve many unsolved scientific questions!</p>

  <h2>My current works:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Phylogenomics of the Erebine lineage</strong> (subfamily Erebinae and its neighboring taxa)</li>
    <li>Systematic taxonomy of the subfamily Erebinae in Korea</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>My interests encompasses the following ends:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Phylogenomics of Lepidoptera (especially Noctuoidea, Erebidae) and their high biodiversity</li>
    <li><strong>Coevolution</strong> of Lepidoptera and Angiosperm</li>
    <li>Evolutionary study by integrative approach with fossil records, ecological features, and omics data</li>
    <li>Biogeography</li>
    <li>Population genetics and species delimitation for detecting over- or underestimation of specific species</li>
  </ul>
